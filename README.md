# Svelte Internationalization

Project developed for the I18N & L10N class at UFSC on the first semester
of 2020. It comes with a
[set of slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12kZX5SCilweH7a6hfjuri6zPC2l6k2GtN6_WOvwLVtQ/edit?usp=sharing),
and is a sample project with examples of localization and internationalization
of websites written in `svelte`.

You can clone the repository, run `npm install`, and `npm run dev` or
`npm build` (see [the svelte docs](https://svelte.dev/) for more info) to see
the sample project, or access the
[available website](https://svelte-internationalization.vercel.app/), published
using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
